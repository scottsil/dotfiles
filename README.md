Scott Spagnol Silverman's Dotfiles
==================================
These are files to configure a shell just the way I like it.

Design Principles
-----------------
With appologies to Stanley Kubrick:

> This is my prompt.
>
> ![PS1](https://github.com/sferik/dotfiles/raw/master/screenshots/ps1.png "PS1")
>
> There are many others like it, but this one is mine. My prompt is my best
> friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me,
> my prompt is useless. Without my prompt, I am useless...my prompt and myself
> are defenders of my country, we are the masters of our enemy, we are the
> saviors of my life. So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace. Amen.

My prompt has two lines. The first line tells me where I am. It includes
`whoami`, my `hostname`, my `pwd`, and my `git branch`, if I am within a
repository. The `pwd` contains a trailing slash and is colorized to match the
output of `ls -FG` which I `alias` to `ls`.

Incidentally, my computer is named leon, because it is a MacBook
[Pro](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110413/). If convention holds, my next
computer will be named [upin](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1193138/).

The second line is where the magic happens. It is designed to mirror an `irb`
prompt. This may seem confusing, but I find it quite natural to switch
seamlessly between `bash` and `irb`.

My `.vimrc` is the product of 10 years of tweaking and tuning. Using it is like
having an extra arm. I like `vim` because it makes switching between my editor
and the command line seamless. If you prefer MacVim, I'd recommend carlhuda's
[janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) distribution.

If you managed to make it this far without ever reading [In the Beginning was
the Command Line](http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html), don't bother
going any farther before you do. Seriously.

Installation
------------
    git clone git://github.com/sferik/dotfiles
    cd dotfiles
    bundle install
    bundle exec thor dotfiles:install

Note that Terminal opens a login shell. This means ~/.bash_profile will get executed, not ~/.bashrc. To fix, simply add the following line to your ~/.bash_profile file: `[[ -s ~/.bashrc ]] && source ~/.bashrc`

Inspiration
-----------
These files are an amalgamation of wisdom collected over the years, the sources
of which are too numerous to list. The idea to put them in a repository with an
install script was taken from [Ryan
Bates](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles).
